# Sonicwall
This repository contains the config file for sonicwall integration
with ELK and thus I am trying to write a working filter for sonicwall, 
to analyze and visualize the logs sent from the sonicawall syslog server. 

All that was written is based on the work of operational.io, 
which am trying to adopt for my own purposes.

### NOTE
It has not been tested yet and thus it is likly to fail 
miserably. Please if you find me going wrong it means, I am just taking a 
crack at this for the first time.
