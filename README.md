# Sonicwall
This repository contains the config file for sonicwall integration
with ELK and thus I am trying to write a working filter for sonicwall, 
to analyze and visualize the logs sent from the sonicawall syslog server. 

### NOTE
It has not been tested yet and thus it is likly to fail 
miserably. Please if you find me going wrong it means, I am just taking a 
crack at this for the first time.
